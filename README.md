# Bitburner Scripts
Here are some of my personal scripts for Bitburner that I wrote using NS2. 

## Files

| scan.js | todo | Used to scan the network |
| test.js | never done | Script I use for testing stuff |
| manager.js | todo | Script that always runs on the home server and manages all other scripts, our money, and all other things so we don't have to |
